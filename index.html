		<h2>Quality over quantity</h2>
		<p>
			We are highly selective and publish only a small number of titles each year. We like to discover captivating and unusual new voices, to nurture talent over the long term and to offer readers a diverse range of books that we believe they will
			love as much as we do. Our goal is excellence – excellent writing, excellently published.
