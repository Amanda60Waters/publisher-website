  "blurb": "<b>  A powerful novel about two Egyptian sisters--their divergent fates and the secrets of one family.</b>  ",
  "reviews": "<b>  Exquisite</b>   * Vanity Fair *   A <b>  timely, sweeping tale </b>  that examines the intersection of fate and choice, the pull of culture and identity, family and love . . . <b>  Beautifully written</b>  . * Boston Globe *   Hassib is a <b>  perceptive </b>  writer with a real understanding of how people act - not how they ought to act . . . a novel that's a<b>  s honest as it is engrossing</b>  . * NPR *   Shines as <b>  one of the finest explorations of identity, religion, and culture in modern American literature</b>  . Her background leaves her particularly well situated to develop these themes ... brilliantly illuminates the complications of our world: the clash of religious beliefs, the uneven division of wealth, our classist snobbery, the failure of our best intentions. Yet the story is not simply an examination of problems. It is also a<b>   fervent illustration of the strength and beauty of familial bonds, ties that persist even after death.</b>   * Southern Literary Review *   Hassib . . . articulates the full-bodied chorus of Egypt's voices . . . dismantling stereotypes of her country and culture. In so doing <b>  she exposes mankind's best and worst qualities, our universalities and differences, illuminating all the while the myriad ways in which a heart can be pure.</b>   * New York Times *   A profound and deeply affecting examination of fate and free will, family and identity, sin and redemption, and the unique bond between sisters. * Buzzfeed, 'Summer Books to Be Excited About' *   A captivating novel about family, love, and home. Hassib masterfully excavates the secret loyalties that drive women to make fateful choices and, in so doing, explores important themes of guilt and responsibility, shame and forgiveness. * Laila Lalami, author of Pulitzer Prize finalist The Moor's Account *   <i>  A Pure Heart </i>  is an emotional portrait of sisterly relationships and how political strife and change affects even the most personal aspects of our lives. * Real Simple's \"Best Books of 2019 (So Far) *   [A] gripping contemporary novel about two Muslim sisters. . . . When one sister is killed, the other uncovers continuous challenging questions in her quest for understanding and closure. * Ms. Magazine *   <i>  A Pure Heart</i>   grapples with the question of how to be many things at once. . . . Hassib is especially talented at rendering the small details of daily Egyptian life-not in some exoticized fashion but rather as a foundation on which to lay the wide variety of experiences, ideologies, and aspirations of the country's citizenry. These details found throughout the book, shine. . . . What's most impressive about <i>  A Pure Heart</i>   . . . [is] the novel's meditation on the nature of multiple identities. * Omar El Akkad, BookPage (starred review) *   A multifaceted look at the complicated legacies of identity, religion, and politics in Egypt after the Arab Spring emerges. Even the story of the suicide bomber is given careful consideration in this enlightening, heartrending novel. * Booklist (starred review) *   [<i>  A Pure Heart</i>  ] fluidly explores how even seismic historical events can mix with everyday emotions such as sibling rivalry and insecurity to concoct a potent brew. . . . A devastating definition of the new normal in which revolution does not always deliver real power to institute change. * Kirkus Reviews (starred review) *   A profound tale of two Egyptian Muslim women in the 21st century, and the decisions they make in work and love that determine their destinies. This is a timely, thought-provoking novel that explores the intersection of religion, identity, and politics in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. * BookRiot's \"7 of The Buzziest Beach Reads of The Year *   Hassib's impressive second novel is a fascinating depiction of sisters Rose and Gameela, their shared heritage, and the country that ultimately divides them. . . . Hassib seamlessly transports the reader from one culture to another, eloquently showcasing the triumphs, heartaches, and beliefs shared by the protagonists. * Publishers Weekly *   Hassib draws an intimate portrait of contemporary Egypt, deftly explaining the complexity of political viewpoints regarding the revolution and post-revolutionary years. Through her characters, she shows the subtle differences in class, culture, and religious belief that can cause fractures in families, marriages, and societies. . . . Giving a voice to everyone, even the bomber, Hassib displays empathy and compassion steeped in a deep knowledge of her subject. Recommended. * Library Journal *   A captivating novel about family, love, and home. Hassib masterfully excavates the secret loyalties that drive women to make fateful choices and, in so doing, explores important themes of guilt and responsibility, shame and forgiveness. * Laila Lalami, author of Pulitzer Prize finalist The Moor's Account *   Full of intelligent reflections about exile, this moving novel about two Egyptian sisters-one in New York, the other in Cairo-carefully dramatizes the curdling of individual dreams in the aftermath of the Arab Spring. * Karan Mahajan, author of National Book Award finalist The Association of Small Bombs *   A stunner of a book. Weaving through the lives of two sisters split by destiny, Hassib's latest novel is a story of excavation: of countries and people. With the Egyptian revolution as backdrop, Hassib masterfully explores the loyalties, geographies and histories that can both partition and bind family. * Hala Alyan, author of Dayton Literary Peace Prize and Arab American Book Award winner Salt Houses *   It would be unjust to call Hassib's <i>  A Pure Heart</i>   anything but heartbreaking and beautiful. Nearly every character is trapped between political, religious, and geographic extremes, trying to figure out who they are and what they love. These goals are always in sight, but, for some, ever beyond reach. * Ian Bassingthwaighte, author of Live from Cairo *   Rajia Hassib's latest novel is a lyrical, heartfelt reflection on the Egyptian revolution as well as on the painful secrets that separate two sisters. * Susan Muaddi Darraj, author of Arab American Book Award winner A Curious Land *   A gripping tale of two sisters whose lives intersect with tragic consequences. <i>  A Pure Heart </i>  beats to its own rhythm of heartaches, joy, loss and courage. An extraordinary achievement. * Zeba Talkhani, author of <i>  My Past is a Foreign Country</i>   *",

  "author": "Melvyn Bragg",
  "blurb": "<b>  Melvyn Bragg gives new life to one of the most remarkable love stories in history: the passionate, enduring romance between Heloise and Abelard</b>  .",
  "reviews": "In this fascinating, haunting evocation of two people aflame with passion and love of learning, Melvyn Bragg dramatises the struggle to find consolation in faith -- Elizabeth Buchan * Daily Mail *   The 12th-Century love story of the brilliant scholar Heloise and radical philosopher Peter Abelard has long endured, and here Bragg recreates their tragic tale for a modern audience. It's an atmospheric, thought-provoking retelling. -- Simon Humphreys * Mail on Sunday *   What is distinctive about Bragg's approach is his emphasis on the intellectual content of the learned lovers' affair. In Pope's poem, Eloise makes just one reference to Abelard's \"adored ideas\". Here they are central , and so are hers. -- David Grylls * Sunday Times *   A fictionalised account of legendary star-crossed lovers unfolds in tandem with the struggles of its author . . . it all comes together in a rich tapestry of devotion. -- Hephzibah Anderson * Observer *      Bragg has mastered his sources, chiefly the letters of Abelard and Heloise and Abelard's autobiographical   <i>  Historia Calamitaturn</i>  . By the pen of Arthur the novelist, Bragg with his own flair and perceptive imagination tells their story . . . Bragg's ability to live inside the minds of these two mighty philosophical and theological intellectuals. He understands their agonies, their manipulation . . . and persecution . . . Bragg writes his version of this life-long love with ease and confidence. It is a pleasure to read; and to be reminded of Chaucer's fastidious Prioress whose shining gold brooch declares: \"<i>  Amor vincit omnia</i>  .\"    -- Brian Martin * Spectator *   Bragg brilliantly re-imagines the legendary love story of Heloise and Abelard, uniting the Middle Ages and today in this thrilling novel. * Antonia Fraser *   Melvyn Bragg brings a fascinated attention to the moral complexities of a love story we all thought we knew, but perhaps did not understand well enough.  His compassion for Abelard and Heloise makes brilliantly real and present to us their anguished journey from erotic excess towards the mystical sublime. * Rose Tremain *   A tour de force - a moving, poignant, compelling tale, wonderfully told. I have never read such true and compellingly depicted accounts of sexual desire and encounter, and Paris, both medieval and modern, comes vividly before one. * A.C. Grayling *   [Arthur's and Julia's] reflection on Heloise and Abelard's vividly drawn, complex relationship deepens how we understand its importance. As Arthur says at one stage, the goal is to rescue history from being \"just another story\". In <i>  Love Without End</i>  <i>   </i>  we gain access to politics and religion in another time, but also to human passions that influence us all. -- Will Smith * Cumbria Life *   [Bragg's] efforts to get inside the medieval mind-set make this more than just another historical romance about star-crossed lovers. * Church Times *   Bragg succeeds in showing how important philosophical debates about the true meaning of the Bible were in this century, and how the rivalries between philosophers became ferociously competitive. -- Shirley Whiteside * Herald (Glasgow) *   Henry James thought historical novels were 'tainted by a fatal cheapness'. Not this one. Melvyn Bragg's account of the passionate and painful love affair between the 12th century radical theologian, Peter Abelard, and the brilliant young convent-educated Eloise springs magnificently to life. No cardboard here but the smell and feel of a turbulent time and a doomed relationship, brought up close by a 21st century one. Thrilling. -- Piers Plowright * Tablet *   Melvyn Bragg has shed fresh light on a poignant, obsessive, and magnificent love affair that has been an enduring fascination for readers throughout the centuries. It is Romeo and Juliet before Romeo and Juliet, but it's real, and the passion has such cerebral and emotional depth that it is all encompassing and beyond time. Melvyn Bragg's novel is keenly observed, and the dual timeline brings modern analysis and perception to the story of these medieval lovers, making it new and fresh for a contemporary audience. * Elizabeth Chadwick *",

BARACK OBAMA</b>        Timely, short and essential, FACTFULNESS reveals the power of facts in a post-truth world, by late international sensation Hans Rosling ('a true inspiration' - Bill Gates) and his long-term collaborators Ola and Anna.

  "reviews": "A hopeful book about the potential for human progress when we work off facts rather than our inherent biases. * Barack Obama *   One of the most important books I've ever read-an indispensable guide to thinking clearly about the world. -- Bill Gates   <i>  Factfulness ... </i>  , a light-hearted but data-rich book, calibrates our view of the world and explains how our cognitive processes can lead us astray -- Steven Pinker * New Statesman, The best books of 2018 *   Wonderful... a passionate and erudite message that is all more moving because it comes from beyond the grave... His knack for presentation and delight in statistics come across on every page. Who else would choose a chart of \"guitars per capita\" as a proxy for human progress? * Financial Times *   An assault both on ignorance and pessimism . . . helping countries improve their governance and public health and opening them up to the rule of law and market exchange works. But not by some sort of magic. Because we act. And to this, as Rosling argues, we first have to understand the world we live in. -- Daniel Finkelstein * The Times *   A wonderful guide to an improving world, as well as being a well-stocked source of sound advice as to how to think about factual and statistical claims . . . The book is a pleasure to read - simple, clear, memorable writing - and when you've finished you'll be a lot wiser about the world. You'll also feel rather happier . . . <i>  Factfulness </i>  - the relaxing peace of mind you get when you have a clearer view of how the world really is . . . I strongly recommend this book. -- Tim Harford   We need more of this way of thinking, both in business and politics. Where better to start than a new book by one of Gates' favourite gurus, the late Swedish statistician Hans Rosling . . . in an age of so-called post-truth, this is a celebration of the all too often repudiated but underlying story of relentless human progress. -- Jeremy Warner * Sunday Telegraph *   [Bill] Gates had selected the tomes as his favourite summer reads . . . [which included] feel-good non-fiction . . . celebrating technological progress and genius, such as Hans Rosling's <i>  Factfulness</i>  . -- Gillian Tett * FT Magazine *   Hans Rosling tells the story of \"the secret silent miracle of human progress\" as only he can. But <i>  Factfulness</i>  does much more than that. It also explains why progress is so often secret and silent and teaches readers how to see it clearly. -- Melinda Gates   Three minutes with Hans Rosling will change your mind about the world. * Nature *   <i>  Factfulness </i>  has the power to shift your entire perspective. If you want to understand the world, read it now! -- Rolf Dobelli   Triumphant. * Sunday Times *   Bestselling books about statistics are as rare as unicorns. One that gets to No.1 is as rare as a lunar unicorn. <i>  Factfulness </i>  by Hans Rosling is that moon-based creature . . . engaging. * The Times *   <i>  Factfulness </i>  is a fabulous read, succinct and lively. It asks why so many people - including Nobel laureates and medical researchers - get the numbers so wrong on pressing issues such as poverty, pandemics and climate change... a just tribute to this book and the man would be a global day of celebration for facts about our world. * Nature *   Rosling's final work is about the misconceptions most people hold about the world we live in - it's better than we think - and a plea to think critically. -- Robert Muchamore * Metro *   An unexpectedly uplifting read. * Emerald Street *   The message is refreshingly clear: when you only hold opinions about things you know the facts about, you can see the world more clearly. * Mr Hyde *   I had very high expectations; the book exceeded them. Superb guide to the world and how to be wiser about it. Great storytelling. An inspiration. * Tim Harford *   An insistently hopeful, fact-based booster shot for a doomsaying, world-weary population [which] parts the dingy curtains of global pessimism to reveal an alternate and uplifting perspective on the state of world issues today. Co-written with Rosling's son and daughter-in-law, the book effectively educates, uplifts, and reassures readers. . . In compelling readers to comprehend the positive aspects of world changes using practical thinking tools, Rosling delivers a sunny global prognosis with a sigh of relief. * Kirkus *",
